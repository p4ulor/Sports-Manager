## Introduction
This document describes the requirements for the third phase of the Software Laboratory project.

### Additional Operations
* Add operations to update a sport, a route and an activity. In these operations the user token must be sent in the Authorization header.
* Add operations to search for a sport and a route. The criterias for the search must be defined and documented in the API specification by each group.

### Single Page Application

**Navigation**

* Update and create the HTML views to ensure the navigability defined in the following graph:

![navigation graph](../Navigation.jpg)

* All views now must include links to `Home`, `UsersRankings`, `Sports`, `Routes` and `ActivitiesSearch`.

**Resource creation, update and delete**

Add the necessary views to create/update a sport, a route and an activity. Also support delete for a single activity. 

When using the web application, in no situation the (human) user will have to know and/or insert any id.

## Report ##

The technical report created in the previous phases should be updated and/or extended with the relevant technical information.
Remember the goal is to have a single report, updated through all the project phases.
